# N-able CVE Dashboard & Triage Tool — Full Technical Changelog

---

## Architecture Overview

The tool consists of six core modules that work together in a strict pipeline:

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | Tkinter GUI — collects inputs, spawns background thread |
| `orchestrator.py` | Controller — coordinates all modules, owns execution flow |
| `data_pipeline.py` | Data engine — load, merge, patch-match, trend arithmetic |
| `excel_builder.py` | Report writer — all Excel sheet construction and formatting |
| `diagnostics.py` | Root-cause classification — patch lag, version drift, mismatches |
| `snapshot.py` | History — lightweight JSON snapshots for trend tracking |
| `cve_lookup.py` | CVE enrichment — NVD / CVE.org / OSV / cvelistV5 lookups |
| `version_sync.py` | Baseline sync — fetches rolling baselines from vendor APIs |

---

## Release History

---

### v0.1 — Initial Build
**Files:** all

The tool existed as a single monolithic Python script (`N-able_CVE_Dashboard_7.py`). All logic — loading, merging, trend math, Excel writing — lived in one file. No GUI. Run via command line with hardcoded paths.

---

### v0.2 — Architecture Refactor: Modular Split

**Files:** `orchestrator.py`, `data_pipeline.py`, `excel_builder.py`, `main.py`

Split the monolith into the current module architecture. Tkinter GUI added. Each module given strict responsibilities with zero cross-contamination (no Excel logic in data_pipeline, no data processing in main.py).

---

### v0.3 — Core Pipeline Fixes

#### Triage Scope Bug (Critical)
**File:** `orchestrator.py`

`filtered_df` included RESOLVED rows, causing product sheets and "New This Month" to treat resolved Office detections as active. 

**Fix:** Introduced a clean two-scope system:
- `filtered_df` — all rows above score threshold (evidence/history scope)
- `triage_df` — UNRESOLVED only, not-in-RMM excluded (active triage scope)

Product sheets, trend math, and exposure counts all use `triage_df`. Raw Data and Resolved sheets use `filtered_df`.

#### Score Threshold Default (Critical)
**Files:** `orchestrator.py`, `main.py`, `run_dashboard.py`

Default threshold was `9.0` but was being compared against the wrong column in some code paths. Hardcoded to `9.0` consistently across all entry points with a `float()` cast, with the CVSS `Vulnerability Score` column explicitly targeted.

**Fix:** `run_dashboard.py` CLI default aligned to `9.0` (was `1.0`). All three entry points now use the same default and target the same column.

#### RMM Merge — LEFT vs INNER Join
**File:** `orchestrator.py`

`exclude_missing_rmm=True` caused an INNER join that silently dropped devices not in the RMM inventory before any filtering ran. 

**Fix:** Default changed to `exclude_missing_rmm=False`. Unmatched devices are marked `'Not Found in RMM'` in the `Last Response` column and excluded from triage sheets but retained in Raw Data.

---

### v0.4 — Patch Matching Engine

#### Status Column Collision (Critical Bug)
**File:** `data_pipeline.py` — `process_patch_match()`

Both the CVE export and the patch report have a `Status` column. After the pandas merge with `suffixes=('', '_p')`, the CVE status (`RESOLVED`/`UNRESOLVED`) stayed as `Status` while the patch install status (`Installed`/`Pending`) became `Status_p`. Three classifier functions — `_classify_version_check`, `_classify_resolution`, `_classify_baseline_compliance` — all read `row.get('Status', '')`, so they silently consumed the CVE threat status instead of the patch install status. Every single row returned `'Patch not yet installed'` regardless of actual patch state.

**Fix:** Renamed patch `Status` to `_patch_status` before the merge, so classifiers read `row.get('_patch_status', '')`. After classification, `_patch_status` is renamed back to `Status_p` for display. This fixed 763 rows that should have shown `Patch confirmed` but were showing `Unresolved`.

#### `_RULES` Mapping for Pending/Installing/Missing/Failed States
**File:** `diagnostics.py`

`Matched - installing`, `Matched - pending`, `Matched - missing`, `Matched - failed` all mapped to `cause = None`, silently dropping those rows from `root_cause_df`. The `DISPLAY_MAP` and `_PENALTIES` entries for `patch_installing`, `patch_pending`, `patch_missing` already existed but were never reached.

**Fix:** These four statuses now map to their correct internal cause codes so they appear in the evidence summary and contribute to health scores.

#### Microsoft Office 365 Product Key Bug
**File:** `excel_builder.py`

`get_base_product()` stripped `365` as a version suffix, so `'Microsoft Office 365'` resolved to `'office'` instead of `'office365'`, causing sheet lookup failures and Office CVEs not being marked resolved even when the raw data showed `RESOLVED`.

**Fix:** `_sheet_pk` now derived from the raw `Affected Products` column values in each group, not from the base product name.

#### Resolved Sheet Consolidation
**Files:** `excel_builder.py`, `orchestrator.py`

`'Patch Confirmed'` and `'Resolved (Patch Confirmed)'` were separate sheets with overlapping content. The orchestrator now pre-merges all raw `Status=RESOLVED` rows with patch-confirmed rows before writing. Single sheet: `'Resolved (Patch Confirmed)'`.

---

### v0.5 — Trend Engine: Ghost Ticket Fix

#### Raw Data as Absolute Source of Truth
**File:** `data_pipeline.py` — `compute_trends()`

Previous behaviour: `compute_trends` implicitly trusted manual `_Checkbox_Resolved` checkboxes from the previous month's report. If a CVE was ticked resolved last month, it was hidden from the Persisting set even if the raw scanner still marked it UNRESOLVED.

**Fix:** `compute_trends` no longer filters based on previous checkboxes. If a CVE is UNRESOLVED in raw data, it persists. The checkbox data is read separately and used only for re-detection tracking — never to exclude rows from arithmetic.

#### `load_previous_report` Tuple Return
**File:** `data_pipeline.py`

`load_previous_report` previously attached `_Checkbox_Resolved` as a column on the returned DataFrame, which allowed it to flow into `_active_trend_scope` and corrupt trend arithmetic.

**Fix:** The function now returns `(df, resolved_pairs)` — a clean DataFrame with no checkbox contamination, plus a standalone `set` of `(device, cve_id)` tuples. `compute_trends` receives `prev_resolved_pairs` as a keyword parameter and uses it only for re-detection flagging.

#### `_active_trend_scope` — Stale and Not-in-RMM Exclusion
**File:** `data_pipeline.py`

Stale devices were not being fully purged from trend math in all code paths. Not-in-RMM devices could also bleed into trend arithmetic when `skip_rmm=True` or no RMM was provided.

**Fix:** `_active_trend_scope()` now:
1. Filters `Not Found in RMM` rows explicitly (guards on column presence, logs debug note if absent for older report format)
2. Applies `inventory_devices` filter
3. Applies `stale_devices` filter

All three exclusions are now unconditional and applied in the same function so every caller uses identical logic.

#### Snapshot Month Key Bug
**File:** `snapshot.py`

`load_history()` year calculation used `now.year - (now.month - 1 - i < 0)` — boolean subtraction that only ever subtracts one year, producing wrong keys for any window spanning more than one year boundary.

**Fix:** `yr = now.year + (now.month - 1 - i) // 12` — Python's floor division correctly handles any number of months backward across arbitrary year boundaries.

#### `report_month` Added to Snapshot Records
**File:** `snapshot.py`

Snapshots were keyed by OS execution month, so generating "April" in May would be stored under `2026-05`. The user-supplied `report_month` label is now parsed and used as the aggregate file key.

---

### v0.6 — Data Transparency: Waterfall Reconciliation

#### `build_client_summary_sheet` Signature Change (Critical)
**File:** `excel_builder.py`

Old signature: `(workbook, filtered_df, trend_data=None, ...)`. The orchestrator was calling with `(wb, filtered_df, triage_df, threshold, trend_data=trend_data, ...)`. Python bound `triage_df` to `trend_data` positionally, then hit `trend_data=` as a keyword — "got multiple values for argument 'trend_data'".

**Fix:** New signature: `(workbook, filtered_df, triage_df, threshold, trend_data=None, ...)`. All four positional args explicit; `trend_data` is keyword-only.

#### Data Filtering Reconciliation Waterfall Table
**File:** `excel_builder.py` — `build_client_summary_sheet()`

Added a new table to the Client Summary sheet that makes the filtering math fully transparent:

```
[+]  Total raw detections (all devices, CVSS ≥ threshold)
[-]  Excluded: stale devices (Last Response before <cutoff>)
[-]  Excluded: device not found in RMM
[=]  Active tracked scope (Key Metrics above)
```

Answers the question "where did 2,000 rows go?" with exact numbers per exclusion reason. Note below the table explains why unique Device and CVE Type counts don't subtract as cleanly as row counts (overlap between excluded and active groups).

#### Key Metrics Now Source from `triage_df` Only
**File:** `excel_builder.py`

All Key Metrics (total rows, unique CVEs, unique devices, server count, exploit count, etc.) now read exclusively from `triage_df` (active scope). Previously they read from `filtered_df` which included not-in-RMM rows, inflating every metric.

---

### v0.7 — Not-in-RMM Audit Tracking

#### Not-in-RMM Devices Added to Stale Sheets
**Files:** `orchestrator.py`, `excel_builder.py`

Devices "Not Found in RMM" were previously excluded silently — counted in the waterfall but not listed anywhere for investigation.

**Fix:** Both stale sheet builders now receive `not_in_rmm_df` and render two clearly labelled sections:

**`build_stale_excluded_sheet`** — two sections:
- `⏱ Date-Stale Devices` — pale amber rows (`#FFFDE7`), amber header (`#FFF2CC`)
- `🚫 Not Found in RMM` — pale red rows (`#FFEBEE`), dark red header (`#C00000`)

**`build_stale_cves_sheet`** — same two-section layout with CVE/NVD hyperlinks colour-matched to their section. Both sections show UNRESOLVED CVEs only, pulled from raw data.

Explanatory note: "N-able is still reporting vulnerabilities for a device absent from the RMM inventory — verify decommission status (shadow IT / orphaned agent)."

#### `not_in_rmm_df` Extracted in Orchestrator
**File:** `orchestrator.py`

Changed from `not_in_rmm = int(...)` (count only) to `not_in_rmm_df = filtered_df[...].copy()` (full DataFrame). The stale sheet trigger changed from `if not stale_excluded.empty` to `if not stale_excluded.empty or not not_in_rmm_df.empty` so either exclusion type independently triggers the sheets.

---

### v0.8 — Username Column

#### Username Propagated from RMM Throughout Pipeline
**File:** `data_pipeline.py`

The RMM Device Inventory report includes a `Username` (logged-on user) column which was never brought into the merged dataset.

**Fix:**
- `load_rmm_data()` detects `Username` under multiple aliases: `username`, `user name`, `logged-on user`, `logged on user`, `current user`, `user` (case-insensitive). Any match is standardised to `'Username'`. If no match exists, the column is created empty.
- `merge_data()` conditionally appends `'Username'` to `rmm_pull` when present in `df_rmm`.
- After merge: `merged['Username'] = merged['Username'].fillna('')` so not-in-RMM rows get blank rather than NaN.
- Username flows automatically into `filtered_df`, `triage_df`, `stale_excluded`, and all downstream sheets. Both stale sheet builders include `'Username'` in `cols_to_keep`.

---

### v0.9 — GUI: Fullscreen, Menu Restructure, Patch Options to Advanced Dialog

**File:** `main.py`

#### Fullscreen Support
- `resizable(True, True)` — both axes freely resizable
- `root.state("zoomed")` — opens maximised on Windows
- `root.minsize(520, 600)` — prevents unusable shrinking

#### Restructured Help Menu
Previous: no menu at all. New structure:
```
Help
  ├─ Advanced — Patch Report Options…
  ├─ ─────────────────────────────
  ├─ Update CVE Data  (git pull cvelistV5)
  ├─ ─────────────────────────────
  └─ About
```

#### Patch Options Behind Advanced Dialog
Patch Report and Patch Failure Report widgets removed from the main window. `Help > Advanced` opens a modal `Toplevel` dialog containing those widgets. StringVars persist across opens so file paths are remembered. A one-line status indicator on the main window (`"No patch data (Help ▸ Advanced to configure)"` / `"Patch: filename.csv"`) shows current state at a glance without opening the dialog.

#### Input Validation Added
- `score_var`: `float()` conversion now wrapped in `try/except ValueError` with a user-friendly error message
- `date_var`: `datetime.strptime(..., "%d/%m/%Y")` validation before dispatch — previously a malformed date silently fell back to `1900-01-01`, excluding all devices as stale

#### Progress Bar Stabilised
Progress bar moved into a fixed-height `tk.Frame` with `pack_propagate(False)`. `grid_remove()` hides it between runs without destroying the widget, eliminating layout jitter on subsequent runs.

#### Update CVE Data
`git pull` on the `cvelistV5` repo runs in a daemon background thread. Searches for the repo at the hardcoded default path, then falls back to the script's parent directory. Handles: `git` not on PATH, 120-second timeout, arbitrary exceptions — all surfaced via `root.after()` on the main thread.

---

### v0.10 — CLI Parity Fix

**File:** `run_dashboard.py`

- `--threshold` default changed from `1.0` to `9.0` to match GUI default
- `--report-month` argument added — allows retroactive labelling of runs (`"April 2026"` generated in May). Passed through to `DashboardRequest.report_month`
- `--since` date format updated to `dd/mm/yyyy` to match `dayfirst=True` parsing throughout pipeline

---

### v0.11 — Garbage Cleanup

**File:** `data_pipeline.py`


Removed redundant duplicate `_sr` assignment in `process_patch_match()` that ran before the `_patch_status` rename (result was immediately overwritten by the post-rename assignment).

---

### v0.12 — Memory Footprint Reductions

**Files:** `data_pipeline.py`, `orchestrator.py`, `requirements.txt`

**Problem:** Processing large N-able/RMM exports through pandas was consuming ~1.7 GB of RAM due to two compounding issues: pandas defaulting all text columns to the `object` dtype (a pointer-per-row to heap-allocated Python strings), and a chain of defensive `.copy()` calls in the orchestrator that duplicated the merged DataFrame multiple times in memory.

**Changes:**

`data_pipeline.py` — Added `_downcast_low_cardinality(df, cols)` helper that casts low-cardinality string columns to `category` dtype. Category stores each unique string value once and uses integers for all rows, typically cutting per-column RAM by ~90%. Called from:
- `load_vulnerability_data` — casts `Vulnerability Severity`, `Threat Status`, `Has Known Exploit`, `CISA KEV`
- `load_rmm_data` — casts `Device Type`
- `merge_data` — re-downcasts the merged frame after all conditional `.loc` writes are complete

`data_pipeline.py` — Switched `pd.read_csv` in `load_vulnerability_data` to `dtype_backend='pyarrow'` with a silent fallback to the default backend. PyArrow-backed strings share memory more aggressively than Python-object strings. Requires `pyarrow>=14`.

`data_pipeline.py` — Added explicit decategorise step immediately after `pd.merge()` inside `merge_data`. Categorical columns reject `.loc[mask, col] = value` writes for values not in their category list and raise `TypeError`. `Device Type` and `Last Response` are cast back to `object` right after the merge (before any conditional writes), then re-downcasted to `category` at the end of the function.

`orchestrator.py` — Removed `.copy()` from `filtered_df`, `triage_df`, and `not_in_rmm_df`. Confirmed by grep + audit that `excel_builder.py` only reads from these frames via `.loc[mask, col]` returning `.nunique()` counts — no assignments. Kept `.copy()` on `raw_df` (required, as `merged_df` is mutated by the date filter below it) and `stale_excluded` (detaches from `merged_df` before the filter rebind).

`requirements.txt` — Added `pyarrow>=14` as an optional-but-recommended dependency.

**What was deliberately NOT changed:**

`xlsxwriter` `constant_memory=True` — `build_overview_sheet` writes column 0 down rows r0..r0+3, then jumps back to row r0 to start column 4. `constant_memory` mode flushes rows as the write cursor advances and raises on writes to already-closed rows. Unsafe without refactoring the overview sheet to write strictly top-to-bottom.

`usecols` on `pd.read_csv` — CVE export column names are not fixed; `load_vulnerability_data` handles aliasing across `cvss score` / `cvss v3.1 base score` / `base score` / etc. A static `usecols` list would silently drop columns on exports with different headers. Categorical dtype gives the same memory benefit without the brittleness.

---

### v0.13 — Vectorised Merge: 41s → 1s

**Files:** `data_pipeline.py`, `excel_builder.py`

**Problem:** Total run time was ~40 seconds. Profiling via log timestamps isolated the entire delay to `merge_data` — loading was instant, Excel writing was ~7s. The root cause was two row-by-row `.apply()` loops both calling `parse_last_response()`, which internally calls `pd.to_datetime()` per-row inside a Python `try/except`:

```python
# Before — called twice across 11,161 rows each
merged['_Sort_Time'] = merged['Last Response'].apply(parse_last_response)          # loop 1
merged['Days Since Last Response'] = merged['Last Response'].apply(_calc_days_from_lr)  # loop 2 — also called parse_last_response internally
```

On 11k rows: 22,322 individual Python-level datetime parse attempts. Measured at ~41 seconds.

**Fix — `data_pipeline.py`:** Replaced both `.apply()` loops with a single vectorised pass:

```python
# After — one bulk pd.to_datetime call covers both columns
_sort_time = pd.to_datetime(_lr_str.where(~_sentinel_mask, other=pd.NaT),
                            errors='coerce', format='mixed', dayfirst=False)
merged['_Sort_Time'] = _sort_time.fillna(_epoch)

# Days reuses the already-parsed series — no second parse
_days_num = (_now - merged['_Sort_Time']).dt.days.clip(lower=0).astype(object)
_days_num[_no_data] = '—'
merged['Days Since Last Response'] = _days_num
```

- `format='mixed'` explicitly handles the mix of date formats in N-able exports and silences the `UserWarning: Could not infer format` that appeared when pandas fell back to element-by-element `dateutil` parsing
- Sentinel rows (`Not Found in RMM`, `N/A`, empty) masked out before parsing, set to `'—'` after
- `parse_last_response()` itself is unchanged — still used by other callers outside `merge_data`

**Fix — `excel_builder.py`:** Added `observed=True` to `filtered_df.groupby('Device Type')` call. Silences `FutureWarning: The default of observed=False is deprecated` that pandas emits when grouping on a categorical column without explicitly stating observed behaviour. `observed=True` is correct here — only device types actually present in the filtered data should appear in the count.

**Result:** Merge step 41s → <1s. Total run time 41s → 7s on 11,161 CVE rows / 276 devices with trend comparison enabled.

---

### v0.14 — Resilience & Maintainability Pass

**Files:** `data_pipeline.py`, `diagnostics.py`, `orchestrator.py`

Based on a technical review of the core engine identifying four categories of improvement: row iteration performance, exception specificity, path handling consistency, and global state safety.

#### iterrows() → itertuples() / bulk assignment

`iterrows()` boxes every row into a full pandas Series object — heap allocation, dtype coercion, attribute lookup overhead per row. `itertuples()` returns a lightweight C-level namedtuple with direct attribute access, typically 10–50× faster.

Converted the following loops:

`data_pipeline.py` — `_apply_cascade_resolution` `has_ver` build loop: `iterrows()` → `itertuples(index=False)`. Column names with spaces (`Matched Patch`, `Matched Patch Version`, `Patch Install Date`) accessed via `getattr(row, 'Matched_Patch', '')` (itertuples replaces spaces with underscores).

`data_pipeline.py` — `_apply_cascade_resolution` write-back loop: kept as `iterrows()` because it needs the integer index `idx` to collect into `resolve_indices`. Refactored from `df.at[idx] = value` inside the loop to collecting all indices first, then a single `df.loc[resolve_indices, 'Patch Evidence Status'] = 'Patch confirmed - pending rescan'` bulk assignment after the loop — reduces write overhead and avoids repeated copy-on-write triggers.

`data_pipeline.py` — `load_previous_report` checkbox loop: `iterrows()` → `itertuples(index=False)`. Accesses `row.Name` and `row.Vulnerability_Name`.

`data_pipeline.py` — `compute_patch_diagnostics` (stub): both `lag_rows` and `mismatch_rows` loops converted to `itertuples`. Note: the active version of this function lives in `diagnostics.py`; the stub in `data_pipeline.py` is unused by the orchestrator but kept consistent.

`diagnostics.py` — `build_recommended_actions` loop: `iterrows()` → `itertuples(index=False)`. Accesses `Patch_Evidence_Notes`, `Product`, `Device`.

`diagnostics.py` — `compute_patch_diagnostics` root cause loop: `iterrows()` → `itertuples(index=False)`. All `row.get('Column Name', '')` calls replaced with `getattr(row, 'Column_Name', '')`.

`diagnostics.py` — `compute_patch_diagnostics` lag loop: `iterrows()` → `itertuples(index=False)`.

`orchestrator.py` — `patch_gap_pairs` build loop: `iterrows()` → `itertuples(index=False)`. Accesses `row._nk`, `row._ck`, `row._root_cause` (all underscore-prefixed, so no space substitution needed).

#### Exception specificity

`data_pipeline.py` — `parse_last_response`: replaced three `except Exception: pass` clauses with `except (ValueError, TypeError): pass` (and `except (ValueError, TypeError, AttributeError)` for the digits/timedelta branch). Bare `except Exception` swallows `KeyboardInterrupt`, `MemoryError`, and `SystemExit` — exceptions that should propagate. The new clauses catch only what `pd.to_datetime` and `int()` actually raise on bad input.

The sheet-level `except Exception: continue` in `load_previous_report` is intentionally left broad — it guards against arbitrary `xlsxwriter` parse failures from malformed or encrypted product sheets, where the correct action is always to skip and continue regardless of failure mode.

#### Path handling

`data_pipeline.py` — `load_previous_report`: replaced four `os.path.basename(file_path)` calls with `Path(file_path).name`. Added `from pathlib import Path` to imports. `pathlib` is already used throughout `orchestrator.py`; this brings `data_pipeline.py` into alignment.

#### Global state (noted, not yet refactored)

The review correctly identified `FIXED_VERSION_RULES.clear() / .update()` in `orchestrator._try_sync_baselines` as a global mutation risk under concurrent runs. Full remediation requires threading `rules` as an explicit parameter through `process_patch_match`, `_apply_cascade_resolution`, and `cve_lookup.enrich_from_detections` — a cross-cutting change deferred to a dedicated refactor. The current tool is single-threaded from the GUI, so this is low risk today. Noted here for the next architecture pass.

#### Tkinter thread safety (confirmed, no change needed)

Reviewed `main.py` — all cross-thread UI updates already use `root.after(0, callback)`. The `git pull` background thread writes only to local variables and queues results through `root.after`. No direct widget access from background threads found. Current implementation is correct.

---

## Known Architecture Decisions

- **`not_in_rmm_df` excluded from trend arithmetic** — Not-in-RMM rows are excluded from `_active_trend_scope` via the `Last Response != 'Not Found in RMM'` filter regardless of whether an RMM inventory was provided. This is intentional: devices with no confirmed identity in the managed estate must not generate phantom New/Resolved/Persisting signals.

- **`_Checkbox_Resolved` removed from DataFrame** — Manual checkbox state from previous reports is kept as a standalone `set` returned from `load_previous_report` and passed explicitly to `compute_trends`. It is used only for re-detection tracking (identifying CVEs ticked resolved last month that re-appeared). It never touches any DataFrame that feeds `_active_trend_scope`.

- **`Status_p` naming preserved for display** — The patch report's `Status` column is renamed to `_patch_status` before the merge to avoid collision with the CVE `Status` column, then renamed back to `Status_p` before the internal column drop so the Excel output column name users see is unchanged.
