# Attempt to sync baselines if requested, and if the version_sync module is available.
# This is a best-effort attempt to keep baseline version rules up to date without requiring users to manually update config.json.
# If syncing fails (e.g. due to network issues or missing module), the dashboard will still run with existing baselines, and a debug message will be logged.
# If baselines are updated, the in-memory FIXED_VERSION_RULES will be refreshed to reflect the new values, and an info message will summarize the changes.
# This allows users to benefit from updated baselines without needing to understand or run the version_sync tool themselves, while ensuring that dashboard functionality is not disrupted if syncing is not possible.
# Note: For this to work, the version_sync module must be designed to update the same config.json file that this orchestrator reads from, and the config health check should be robust to any changes made by the sync process.
# The dashboard will always use the baselines as they exist in config.json at the time of loading, so if syncing is enabled and successful, the latest baselines will be applied to the current run. If syncing is disabled or fails, the dashboard will use whatever baselines are currently in config.json, which may be outdated but will not cause errors.
# The sync_baselines function is expected to return a dictionary of updated baselines if any were changed, or an empty dictionary if no updates were needed. The exact structure of this dictionary will depend on how the version_sync module is implemented, but it should allow the orchestrator to log which baselines were refreshed for transparency.
# The dashboard's config health check will validate the structure and values of the fixed_version_rules after syncing, so if the sync process introduces any issues (e.g. malformed versions), these will be caught and logged as warnings without breaking the dashboard generation.
# Overall, this approach provides a seamless way to keep vulnerability baselines current while maintaining the robustness and reliability of the dashboard generation process.
# The _try_sync_baselines function is intentionally designed to be non-intrusive and resilient, ensuring that the dashboard can still be generated successfully even if baseline syncing encounters issues. This allows users to opt in to baseline syncing for improved accuracy without risking disruption to their workflow.
# If you want to disable baseline syncing, simply set sync_baselines=False in the DashboardRequest, and the dashboard will use the existing baselines from config.json without attempting to update them.
# If you want to enable baseline syncing, set sync_baselines=True in the DashboardRequest, and the orchestrator will attempt to sync baselines at the start of the run. Any updates will be logged, and the latest baselines will be applied to the vulnerability data processing.
# Note: The version_sync module and its sync_baselines function are not defined in this code snippet, so you will need to implement them separately. The sync_baselines function should handle the logic of checking for updates to baselines (e.g. by fetching from a remote source), updating the config.json file if needed, and returning a summary of any changes made.
# The dashboard's fixed version rules are critical for accurately assessing vulnerability risk and remediation status, so keeping them up to date can significantly enhance the value of the dashboard. By providing an optional syncing mechanism, we allow users to easily benefit from updated baselines while ensuring that the dashboard remains functional and reliable regardless of syncing success.
# In summary, the _try_sync_baselines function is a key part of the orchestrator's ability to maintain current vulnerability baselines, and it is designed to be robust and user-friendly, providing benefits without risks to the dashboard generation process.

# The main request and result dataclasses for the dashboard orchestrator.
# DashboardRequest encapsulates all input parameters needed to run the dashboard generation, including file paths, options for filtering and including data, and report metadata.
# DashboardResult encapsulates the outcome of the dashboard generation, including success status, output path, messages, trend summary data, and any warnings that were generated during processing.
# By using dataclasses, we can easily create and manage these structured data objects, and they provide a clear contract for the inputs and outputs of the orchestrator's run function.
# The run function will take a DashboardRequest, execute the entire dashboard generation process (loading data, merging, filtering, computing trends, processing patches, building the Excel workbook), and return a DashboardResult that indicates whether the process was successful and includes any relevant information or warnings for the user.
# The DashboardRequest includes options for skipping RMM data, including patch information, generating trend analyses, and applying date filters, allowing for flexible dashboard generation based on the user's needs and available data.
# The DashboardResult includes a success flag, the path to the generated output file, any messages for the user (e.g. errors or informational notes), a summary of trend data if applicable, and a list of warnings that may be relevant to the user when interpreting the dashboard.
# Overall, these dataclasses provide a clean and organized way to manage the inputs and outputs of the dashboard generation process, and they help to ensure that the orchestrator's run function has a clear and consistent interface.
# Note: The actual implementation of the run function will involve calling various helper functions and modules to perform the necessary data processing and Excel generation, and it will need to handle exceptions gracefully to ensure that a meaningful DashboardResult is returned even in the case of errors.

It returns a list of any issues found, which can be logged as warnings to inform the user of potential problems with the configuration that may affect the accuracy or functionality of the dashboard.
# The function checks for duplicate keys in the product_map, ensures that all products referenced in fixed_version_rules have a corresponding entry in product_map, and validates that any version strings in fixed_version_rules are properly formatted. It also checks for cases where Chrome and Edge have identical version rules for the same CVE, which is not allowed. Any issues found are collected in a list and returned for logging.
# By performing this health check at the start of the dashboard generation process, we can catch and inform the user of any configuration issues that may lead to inaccurate vulnerability assessments or other problems in the generated dashboard, allowing them to address these issues before relying on the dashboard's insights.
# The health check is designed to be non-intrusive, meaning that it will not prevent the dashboard from being generated even if issues are found, but it will provide valuable feedback to the user about potential problems in the configuration that they may want to fix for better results.
# Note: The specific checks performed in this function are based on the expected structure of the config.json file and the requirements for how product mappings and version rules should be defined. If any issues are found, they will be logged as warnings, but the dashboard generation will proceed using whatever configuration is present, allowing users to still generate a dashboard while being informed of any potential issues with their setup.
# The use of regular expressions to validate version strings ensures that any versions specified in the fixed_version_rules are in a format that can be parsed and compared correctly, which is critical for the accurate assessment of vulnerability risk and remediation status in the dashboard.
