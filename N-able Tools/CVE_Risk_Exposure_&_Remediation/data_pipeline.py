# The _KB_RE is designed to extract KB article numbers from text, which are often used in Microsoft patch information. The _CVE_RE is designed to extract CVE identifiers, which follow a specific format of CVE-YYYY-NNNNN. The _VERSION_RE is designed to extract version numbers that may be in the format of major.minor.patch (e.g. 1.2.3) and can have between 2 and 5 components. The _DIGITS_RE is a simple regex to extract sequences of digits, which can be useful for parsing version numbers or other numeric information from text.

# PATCH GAP CLASSIFICATION
# This section includes functions and mappings to classify the gap between detected vulnerabilities and patch information. The classify_patch_gap function takes the patch match result and resolution status for a given vulnerability and determines if there is a gap in coverage, an unmanaged application, or a detection mismatch. The _GAP_NO_MATCH mapping is used to categorize specific no-match results from the patch matching process, while the _MATCHED_INSTALLED set is used to identify cases where the patch tool indicates that a patch is installed but the vulnerability is still detected by N-able, which may indicate a detection mismatch. By classifying these gaps, we can provide more actionable insights into the vulnerability management process and help users understand where there may be issues with patch coverage or detection accuracy.
# The classify_patch_gap function returns a specific gap category based on the patch match result and resolution status, which can then be used in the dashboard to highlight areas where there may be gaps in patch coverage or discrepancies between patch information and vulnerability detection. This helps users to prioritize their remediation efforts and focus on the most critical issues that may not be adequately addressed by their current patching strategy.
# The gap categories include 'coverage_gap' for vulnerabilities that are not found in the patch report, 'unmanaged_app' for devices that are in the patch report but the product is not found, and 'detection_mismatch' for cases where the patch tool indicates that a patch is installed but the vulnerability is still detected as unresolved. By identifying these gaps, users can take targeted actions to improve their vulnerability management and ensure that critical vulnerabilities are being effectively addressed.    
# Note: The classify_patch_gap function is designed to be flexible and can be easily extended in the future to include additional gap categories or handle new patch match results as needed. It provides a clear and structured way to classify the relationship between detected vulnerabilities and patch information, which is essential for effective vulnerability management and remediation prioritization.

# DATA LOADING & NORMALIZATION
# This section includes functions for loading data from CSV or Excel files, normalizing device names, extracting base product names, cleaning sheet names for Excel, extracting CVE IDs from text, determining device types based on OS strings, and parsing last response values into timestamps. These functions are essential for preparing the raw data for analysis and ensuring that it is in a consistent format for merging and processing in the dashboard generation. By normalizing device names and product names, we can improve the accuracy of merges between vulnerability data and RMM inventory data. The extraction functions help to pull relevant information from messy input strings, which is common in vulnerability and patch data. Overall, this section provides the necessary tools to transform raw input data into a structured format that can be effectively used in the subsequent analysis and dashboard generation steps.
# The load_data function can handle both CSV and Excel files, making it flexible for different input formats. The normalize_device_name function standardizes device names by stripping whitespace, converting to uppercase, and removing domain or subdomain components. The get_base_product function extracts a simplified product name by removing architecture tags and version information. The clean_sheet_name function ensures that sheet names for Excel are valid and unique. The extract_cve_id function pulls CVE identifiers from either raw strings or HYPERLINK formulas. The determine_device_type function classifies devices as 'Server', 'Workstation', or 'Unknown' based on their OS strings. The parse_last_response function converts various formats of last response values into sortable timestamps, which is crucial for analyzing the recency of vulnerability detections and responses.
# By using these functions to preprocess the data, we can ensure that the subsequent merging and analysis steps in the dashboard generation will be more accurate and effective, leading to a more insightful and actionable dashboard for users to understand their vulnerability landscape and prioritize remediation efforts.
# Note: These functions are designed to be robust and handle a variety of input formats and edge cases, which is important given the often messy nature of vulnerability and inventory data. By implementing these normalization and extraction functions, we can improve the quality of our data and the insights derived from it in the CVE dashboard.

# The load_data function is designed to handle both CSV and Excel file formats, making it flexible for different types of input data. It checks the file extension to determine whether to use pandas' read_excel or read_csv function to load the data into a DataFrame. This allows users to provide their vulnerability and inventory data in the format that is most convenient for them, without needing to convert it beforehand. By returning a DataFrame, this function provides a consistent data structure for subsequent processing steps in the dashboard generation.
# Note: The function assumes that the input file is well-formed and does not include error handling for cases such as missing files, unsupported formats, or malformed data. In a production environment, it would be advisable to add error handling to provide more informative feedback to the user in case of issues with the input file.

# The _normalize_device_col function is a vectorized version of the normalize_device_name function, designed to operate on entire pandas Series (columns) of device names. It applies the same normalization logic (stripping whitespace, converting to uppercase, and removing domain or subdomain components) to each value in the Series efficiently using pandas string methods. This allows for fast processing of large datasets without the need for explicit loops, which can be slow in Python. By normalizing the device names in a vectorized manner, we can prepare the data for merging and analysis more quickly, improving the overall performance of the dashboard generation process.
# Note: This function assumes that the input Series contains string-like values and will convert any non-string values to strings before applying the normalization. It also handles cases where the expected delimiters ('\\' and '.') may not be present, ensuring that it can process a wide variety of input formats without raising errors. By using this function to normalize device names in the RMM inventory data, we can improve the accuracy of merges with vulnerability data, which is crucial for correctly associating vulnerabilities with the devices they affect in the dashboard.
# The normalization process helps to ensure that device names are consistent across different data sources, which is essential for accurate merging and analysis. By removing domain components and standardizing the case, we can reduce the likelihood of mismatches due to formatting differences, leading to a more accurate and insightful dashboard for users to understand their vulnerability landscape and prioritize remediation efforts effectively.
# Overall, the _normalize_device_col function is a key component of the data preprocessing pipeline, enabling efficient and consistent normalization of device names across large datasets, which is critical for the success of the CVE dashboard generation.

# The get_base_product function is designed to extract a simplified base product name from a given product name string. It removes common architecture tags (such as x64, x86, 32-bit, 64-bit), empty parentheses, and trailing version information to distill the core product name. This is useful for grouping and analyzing vulnerabilities by product without being confounded by variations in how the product name may be formatted in different data sources. By extracting the base product name, we can improve the accuracy of merges between vulnerability data and patch information, as well as enhance the clarity of the dashboard by presenting more concise product names.
# The function uses pre-compiled regular expressions to efficiently remove the unwanted components from the product name. It also ensures that the resulting base product name is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. This helps to standardize product names across different data sources, which is crucial for accurate analysis and reporting in the CVE dashboard. By using this function to extract base product names, we can provide clearer insights into which products are affected by vulnerabilities and how they relate to available patches and remediation efforts.
# Note: The get_base_product function is designed to be flexible and can handle a variety of input formats for product names. However, it may not cover all possible variations, and there may be cases where additional rules or exceptions are needed to accurately extract the base product name. In such cases, the function can be easily extended with additional regex patterns or logic to handle specific edge cases as they arise in the data.

# The clean_sheet_name function is designed to take a raw product name and convert it into a valid Excel sheet name. It removes or replaces characters that are not allowed in sheet names, truncates the name to a maximum of 31 characters, and ensures that the resulting sheet name is unique within the context of already used names. If the input name is empty or consists only of whitespace, it defaults to 'Unknown Product'. The function also handles cases where multiple products may have similar names by appending a numeric suffix to create unique sheet names. This is important for ensuring that the generated Excel file can be created without errors due to invalid or duplicate sheet names, and it helps to maintain clarity and organization in the resulting workbook.
# By using the clean_sheet_name function to generate sheet names for each product in the dashboard,
# we can ensure that the Excel output is well-structured and free of naming issues, which enhances the usability of the dashboard for users who may want to explore the data in Excel. The function's ability to handle edge cases and ensure uniqueness of sheet names contributes to a more robust and user-friendly output.
# Note: The clean_sheet_name function assumes that the input name is a string and will convert non-string inputs to strings. It also uses a set of already used names to ensure uniqueness, which should be maintained and passed correctly when generating sheet names for multiple products. By implementing this function, we can avoid common pitfalls with Excel sheet naming and provide a smoother experience for users interacting with the generated dashboard in Excel.

# The extract_cve_id function is designed to pull a bare CVE identifier (in the format CVE-YYYY-NNNNN) from a given string, which may be a raw string or a HYPERLINK formula commonly found in Excel. It uses the pre-compiled CVE_PATTERN regex to search for the CVE ID within the input string. If a match is found, it returns the CVE ID in uppercase; otherwise, it returns the original input string stripped of whitespace and converted to uppercase. This function is essential for standardizing CVE identifiers across different data sources, which may have varying formats for how CVEs are represented. By extracting and normalizing CVE IDs, we can improve the accuracy of merges and analyses that rely on CVE identifiers in the dashboard.
# The function is designed to be flexible and can handle cases where the input string may contain additional text or formatting around the CVE ID, as it specifically looks for the CVE pattern within the string. This helps to ensure that we can accurately extract CVE IDs even from messy input data, which is common in vulnerability reports and spreadsheets. By using this function to extract CVE IDs, we can ensure that our data is consistent and that we can effectively link vulnerabilities to their corresponding CVE identifiers in the dashboard, providing clearer insights into the vulnerabilities being analyzed and their associated information.
#  Note: The extract_cve_id function assumes that the input string may contain a CVE ID in the expected format, and it will return the first match found. If there are multiple CVE IDs in the input string, it will only return the first one. In cases where the input string does not contain a valid CVE ID, it will return the original string in uppercase, which may not be ideal for all use cases. Depending on the context in which this function is used, additional error handling or validation may be necessary to ensure that the output is appropriate for the intended use in the dashboard.

# The determine_device_type function classifies a device as 'Server', 'Workstation', or 'Unknown' based on the content of its OS string. It checks for specific keywords in the OS string to make this determination. If the OS string contains 'server', it classifies the device as a 'Server'. If it contains 'windows 10' or 'windows 11', it classifies it as a 'Workstation'. If the OS string is 'nan' or 'unknown', it classifies it as 'Unknown'. For any other cases, it defaults to classifying the device as a 'Workstation'. This function helps to categorize devices in the RMM inventory, which can be useful for analyzing vulnerabilities and patch information by device type in the dashboard.
# The function is designed to be simple and relies on keyword matching, which may not cover all possible OS strings or device types. However, it provides a basic classification that can be useful for many common cases. Depending on the specific OS strings encountered in the data, additional rules or keywords may need to be added to improve the accuracy of the classification. By using this function to determine device types, we can enhance the insights provided in the dashboard by allowing users to filter and analyze vulnerabilities and patches based on whether they affect servers or workstations.
# Note: The determine_device_type function assumes that the input OS string is a string-like value and will convert non-string inputs to strings. It also uses simple keyword matching, which may not be sufficient for all cases, especially if there are variations in how OS information is represented in the data. In a production environment, it may be beneficial to implement a more robust classification system that can handle a wider variety of OS strings and device types, potentially using machine learning or more complex rule-based logic if necessary. However, for many common cases, this function provides a straightforward way to classify devices based on their OS information.

# The parse_last_response function converts Last Response values into sortable timestamps. It handles various formats of input values, including special cases like 'Not Found in RMM', 'N/A', and empty strings. For valid date strings, it attempts to convert them to pandas datetime objects. If the conversion fails, it tries to parse the value based on specific patterns, such as 'overdue_' prefixes or time-based descriptions containing 'days' or 'hrs'. If all else fails, it returns a default epoch timestamp. This function is crucial for analyzing the recency of vulnerability detections and responses, allowing us to sort and filter data based on when the last response was recorded. By converting various formats of last response values into a consistent timestamp format, we can enhance the analysis capabilities in the dashboard and provide more actionable insights into the timeliness of responses to detected vulnerabilities.
# The function is designed to be robust and handle a variety of input formats, which is important given the often inconsistent nature of data in RMM inventory reports. By providing a consistent way to parse last response values, we can ensure that our analyses of response times and trends are based on accurate and comparable data, which is essential for effective vulnerability management and remediation prioritization in the dashboard. Note that the function assumes that the input values may be in various formats and includes logic to handle common cases, but there may still be edge cases that require additional handling as they are encountered in real-world data.

# The get_col_letter function converts a zero-based column index into an Excel column letter. It uses a loop to repeatedly divide the column index by 26 and determine the corresponding letter for each position. This is useful for generating Excel formulas or references that require column letters instead of numeric indices. By providing this utility function, we can easily convert between numeric column indices used in pandas DataFrames and the letter-based column references used in Excel, which is essential for creating accurate formulas and references in the generated dashboard when exporting to Excel. The function handles the conversion correctly by accounting for the fact that Excel columns are 1-indexed and that after 'Z' comes 'AA', 'AB', etc. By using this function, we can ensure that any Excel-related operations in the dashboard generation can reference columns accurately, regardless of how many columns are present in the data.

This helps to ensure that the final Excel output is clean and only includes relevant information for the end user, without exposing any intermediate columns that were used for merging, sorting, or other internal operations during the data processing. By using this function before writing to Excel, we can maintain a clear separation between the internal workings of the data pipeline and the final output presented to users in the dashboard.

# PATCH MATCH HELPER FUNCTIONS
# This section includes helper functions for patch matching and classification, such as normalizing text for comparison, extracting architecture information from product names, mapping vulnerability names to products, extracting KB articles and CVE IDs from text, determining the best version from a string, parsing version numbers for comparison, and classifying baseline compliance and version check results. These functions are essential for accurately matching detected vulnerabilities with available patches and determining the compliance status of devices based on their installed patches and the known fixed versions for vulnerabilities. By implementing these helper functions, we can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the patch matching process in the dashboard generation, providing users with clearer insights into their vulnerability landscape and remediation efforts. The functions are designed to handle a variety of input formats and edge cases, which is important given the
# often messy nature of vulnerability and patch data. By using these functions in the patch matching process, we can ensure that we are accurately identifying which patches correspond to which vulnerabilities and providing meaningful classifications of compliance and resolution status for users to act upon in the dashboard.
# Note: The functions in this section are intended to be used as part of the patch matching and classification process, and they may rely on specific formats or conventions in the input data. It is important to ensure that the data being processed is compatible with the expectations of these functions, and additional error handling or validation may be necessary in a production environment to handle unexpected input formats or edge cases. By carefully implementing and using these helper functions, we can improve the overall quality and usefulness of the CVE dashboard for users to understand their vulnerability landscape and prioritize remediation efforts effectively.

# The _norm_compact function normalizes a string by removing all non-alphanumeric characters, converting it to lowercase, and stripping leading and trailing whitespace. This is useful for creating a compact version of a string that can be used for comparison or matching purposes, as it reduces the variability in formatting and allows for more consistent comparisons between strings that may have different punctuation or spacing. By using this function to normalize product names, vulnerability names, or other relevant text fields, we can improve the accuracy of matching and classification in the patch matching process. The _norm_text function is similar but replaces sequences of non-alphanumeric characters with a single space instead of removing them entirely, which can be useful for preserving some separation between words while still normalizing the text for comparison. Both functions help to ensure that we can effectively compare and match strings in a way that is robust to common formatting differences and inconsistencies in the input data, which is essential for accurate analysis and reporting in the CVE dashboard.

This function is useful for extracting architecture information from product names or descriptions, which can be important for accurately matching vulnerabilities to patches that may be specific to certain architectures. By using this function in the patch matching process, we can ensure that we are correctly identifying the relevant patches for each vulnerability based on the architecture of the affected product, which enhances the accuracy and usefulness of the dashboard for users to understand their vulnerability landscape and prioritize remediation efforts effectively.
